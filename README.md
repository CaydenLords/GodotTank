# Overview

I've always wanted to learn how to use a game engine, and Godot is free to use! So I started using it, thinking that it would be an easy learn! _how foolish._

This is my first Godot project! It's a simple program of a tank that you can move around. It also allows you to shoot cannonballs! 
Beyond this, I included some other minor items as practice, such as a timer and a button that changes the functions.

# Development Environment

Obviously this uses Godot, and that's about it! It uses the native programming language GDScript, so it's all contained in the package. 

# Useful Websites

Use the main website for Godot! It has a lot of guides on it. 

- [Introduction to Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html)
- [Godot Manual](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/index.html)

# Future Work

Well, there's a large amount of things that I'd like to learn in the future with Godot, but this project is barely a game! Adding some collision to objects, some enemies, and probably some sort of goal would make this a lot better.
